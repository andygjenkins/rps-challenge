# RPS Challenge


## Instructions in README

As we have seen previously, the README is a great place to show the full story of how your app is used (from a user's perspective).  For a web app, include instructions for how to download and run the app, e.g.:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:andygjenkins/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
$ rerun ruby app.rb
```
